Minimal is a minimal project theme for Jekyll, it's based on the automatic page
theme on GitHub called minimal by Steve Smith (@orderedlist).

```ruby
gem "minimal"
```

```yaml
theme: minimal
```

And then execute:

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/hasharray/minimum.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

You theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme,
run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`.

This starts a Jekyll server using your theme.
Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents.
As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will
regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just
like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, and
`_sass` tracked with Git will be released.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the
[MIT License](http://hasharrayp.pw/minimal/license).
